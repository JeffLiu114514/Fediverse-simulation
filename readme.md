==============================================

This repository contains the code and resources related to our research paper titled "Voting-Based Content Recommendation in the Fediverse", submitted to and is under peer-review at the WorldWideWeb 2025.


## Run Instructions

The major test script is main.py. Please follow the comments in main to decide what parameters are the tests run with. Results are saved under results.json and results.txt. To generate better visualized result graphs, download graphviz executables from https://graphviz.org/download/ and put /Graphviz under project directory.

Run via commandline arguments and more features will be added in the future for camera-ready.
